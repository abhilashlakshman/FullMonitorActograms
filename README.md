# FullMonitorActograms
Codes to bin DAM monitor files and plot actograms of all individuals in a monitor together, with and without environmental profiles overlaid.

This repository has two sets of codes.
One is to bin unscanned DAM monitor files into desired bins and then plot actograms of all individuals in the monitor. This file is called binning_and_full_mon_actograms.R. This file does not have the provision for plotting environmental variables with the actograms.
The second file, called full_mon_acto_w_env.R, does the same thing as above and also plots environmental variables.

Users will have to download ORCA for plotly to capture high quality figures. See here for installation instructions (https://github.com/plotly/orca).

Users must carefully read the instructions in the code to run it correctly. For questions you may write to abhilash1690@gmail.com.
